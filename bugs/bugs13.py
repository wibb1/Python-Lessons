# Bug-Fixing Exercise 1
# The following formula calculates the free-fall time of an object.
#
#
# h is the free-fall distance and g is the gravity. On Earth, gravity is 9.80665 m/s2.
#
# Given the above information, we have created a program that calculates the free-fall time given the free-fall distance h and the gravity g which will be a default parameter with a value of 9.80665:
#
#     def calculate_time(g=9.80665, h):
#         t = (2 * h / g) ** 0.5
#         return t
#
#
#     time = calculate_time(100)
#     print(time)
#
# However, the script produces an error. Try running the script in your IDE and then fix the error so the program successfully calculates the free-fall time.


def calculate_time(h, g=9.80665):
    t = (2 * h / g) ** 0.5
    return t


time = calculate_time(100)
print(time)
