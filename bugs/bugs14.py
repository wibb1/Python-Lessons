# Bug-Fixing Exercise 1
# The program depicted below consists of two Python files. The program tries to count and print out the number of periods in the "Trees are good. Grass is green." . However, running the main.py file returns an error. Please fix the error.
#
# # functions.py:
# def count(phrase):
#     return phrase.count('.')
#
# # main.py:
# import functions
#
# nr_of_periods = count("Trees are good. Grass is green.")
# print(nr_of_periods)

# functions.py:
def count(phrase):
    return phrase.count('.')

# main.py:
import functions

nr_of_periods = functions.count("Trees are good. Grass is green.")
print(nr_of_periods)


# Bug-Fixing Exercise 2
# The same program as in exercise 1 now is throwing yet another error. Hunt the error down and fix it.
#
# main.py:
#
# import functions.py
#
# nr_of_periods = functions.count("Trees are good. Grass is green.")
# print(nr_of_periods)
#
# functions.py:
#
#
# def count(phrase):
#     return phrase.count('.')
#
#
# main.py:

import functions

nr_of_periods = functions.count("Trees are good. Grass is green.")
print(nr_of_periods)

# functions.py:


def count(phrase):
    return phrase.count('.')
#
# Bug-Fixing Exercise 3
# There is another error in the same program. Please fix the error.
#
# main.py:
#
from functions import count

nr_of_periods = count("Trees are good. Grass is green.")
print(nr_of_periods)

# functions.py:
def count(phrase):
    return phrase.count('.')
